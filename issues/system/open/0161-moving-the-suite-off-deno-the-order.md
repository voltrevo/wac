# 0161 — moving the suite off Deno: the order, and what blocks each step

- **Status:** open
- **Claimed by:** (nobody yet — add yourself before working it)
- **Reported by:** agent-b
- **Date:** 2026-08-16
- **Kind:** missing feature
- **Symptom:** not implemented

The goal is no Deno or TypeScript after bootstrapping, except where a JS interaction is wanted.
This is the measured shape of that, and the order the steps have to happen in — recorded because I
got the order wrong twice from reasoning about it.

## The surface

628 TypeScript files outside `site/`. **446 are tests.**

| | files | what it needs |
|---|---:|---|
| `wacTestRun` wrappers, registration and nothing else | **37** | the suite to run `wac test` — **done** |
| `wacTestRun` wrappers with other content | 48 | the same, then their extra content moved |
| bind a wac module and assert from TS | ~180 | rewriting as wac tests |
| spawn a real process | 120 | a decision: may a wac test spawn its own oracle? |
| drive `compiler/` directly | 32 | stays until the reference seed retires |
| `harness/` | 27 | mostly evaporates with the above |
| `tools/` | 48 | separate track; several are natural `wac` subcommands |

## The order, and why it is not the obvious one

**1. The suite runs `wac test`.** Done — `tools/runTests.ts`. This had to be first and I twice wrote
that deleting wrappers was "free". It is not: `runTests.ts` ran `deno test` and nothing else, so the
wrappers *are* how 83 wac test files enter the suite. Deleting them first removes the tests.

**2. `tools/mutate.ts` learns to run a wac test.** This blocks step 3, and that is the correction
worth keeping. Mutation testing selects tests from a coverage profile and runs them with
`deno test --filter <name>`; delete a wrapper and the test it named cannot be run at all, so the
mutant is scored against a suite that no longer contains its test. `wac test` now writes the
per-test profile the tool reads (verified 16 of 16 against the Deno path over `map_test.wac`), so
the selection half is ready and the *running* half is not.

**3. Delete the 37 pure wrappers**, verifying mutation scores unchanged either side.

**4. The oracle question**, which is a decision rather than work — see below.

**5. Tier 2, package by package.** **6. `tools/`.**

## What step 2 actually needs

- **The two profiles name the same test differently.** Native is the export name, `test_basics`;
  the Deno path is the wrapper's prefix plus the stripped name, `map: basics`. Comparing them at all
  meant normalising. The native names are the durable ones — the Deno spelling is a function of an
  argument that stops existing at step 3 — so `mutate` should learn the native names rather than
  either path being made to match.
- **A narrow plan's files can be mixed.** `runDirs` comes from `profile.home`, and a line covered by
  both a wac test and a TypeScript one yields both kinds in one set. `testCommand` returns a single
  `Deno.Command`; a mixed set needs two and their results merged. This is the part that makes step 2
  a change to a thousand-line tool rather than a dispatch on a file extension.
- Both profiles will exist during the transition, so the reader has to merge them.

## The decision in step 4

31 of the 83 wac test files cannot run under `wac test` at all: every test in them takes the oracle
as a *parameter*, supplied by a host. Same for tier 3's 120 TypeScript files, which spawn `bash`,
GNU `tar`, `openssl`, a real TLS server, C tor.

`wac test` already passes `--allow-*` through, and `packages/box` spawns processes from wac, so the
capability exists. The question is whether a test **should** be a program with grants — and it is a
language-shaped question, not a tooling one, because the answer decides whether "a test" and "a
program" are the same kind of thing here.

Answering it "no" is coherent and costs the 151 files a permanent host-side home, which is a smaller
goal than the one at the top of this issue but an honest one.
