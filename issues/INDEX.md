## Closed

41 issues, 33 closed.

Most of the closed ones came from porting `wacc`'s AST to sum types and then probing shapes
that port does not reach. Twelve typechecked cleanly and then failed at instantiation or ran
wrong, which is why `README.md` asks you to run the thing rather than only compile it.

Three were found *by the fix for another one*: the enum no-default rule (0012) made the
sized-array form unusable and produced 0019, and 0019's own fix needed two AST walks updated
— the same omission as 0005. A change that touches the AST or adds a statement form should be
assumed to have missed a walk until checked.

0024 came from asking what the probe rounds had not covered: branch coverage is wac's own
tooling and had never been pointed at `match`, so arms were invisible to it and any coverage
number over a match was overstated.
